# Atoms

A port of Clojure's Atom to javascript. Behaves nicely with React when used with persistent data structures, such as immutable.js or mori.

For motivation, see David Nolens' excellent Om project.

You should initialize the atom with immutable data. If you're not going to, this is not for you.
